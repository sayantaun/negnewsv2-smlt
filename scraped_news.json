(Twitter)\n\nRead Full Story\n\nOn July 11, the Supreme Court handed down a four-month term in a contempt case against fugitive tycoon Vijay Mallya, who was charged in a bank loan default case involving his disbanded Kingfisher Airlines and a debt of over  \u20b99,000 crore. Mallya was also given a  \u20b92,000 fine by a court panel presided over by Justice U U Lalit. \"Adequate punishment is a must. Mallya didn't show any remorse,\" the top court bench said.\n\nMallya is considered a Fugitive Economic Offender (FEO):a person for whom an arrest warrant has been issued in connection with the commission of an offence enumerated in the Act that has a minimum financial impact of Rs. 100 crore is called an FEO.\n\nMoney laundering, forging official stamps or money, dishonouring checks and activities that mislead creditors are some of the offences that are included in the FEO legislation. Vijay Mallya, however, is not the only FEO in India. Here are other such people who fall into the same category.\n\nHajra Iqbal Memon\n\nIn 2021, Hajra Memon, the widow of the deceased gangster Iqbal Mirchi, and her sons Asif and Junaid were designated as an FEO. Mirchi was regarded as wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim's right-hand man. Memons has been charged with using money gained illegally to purchase real estate all across Mumbai. In the case, the ED had attached assets worth  \u20b9800 crore up until 2021. The family resides abroad, but it is mostly unknown where they are.\n\nLalit Modi\n\nThe Indian Premier League (IPL) was first made popular by Lalit Modi. When Lalit was the IPL Commissioner, the scam occurred. Then Multi Screen Media Limited (MSM) (now Sony Pictures Networks India) approached the BCCI following the media rights auction. It announced that World Sports Group (WSG) Mauritius has been given the media rights to broadcast the IPL. However, between BCCI and WSG, there was no such arrangement. Lalit Modi alone negotiated these contracts and, as per reports, he might have received  \u20b9125 crore. He is now in the UK looking for refuge.\n\nAlso Read: 5 things to know about fugitive economic offenders\n\nNitin J. Sandesara and others\n\nOwner of Gujarat-based Sterling Biotech, Nitin J. Sandesara has been designated a FEO due to his default on the  \u20b95,000 crore loaned to Andhra Bank. The swindle ended up costing R 81,000 crore. In this case, Hitesh Narendrabhai Patel, Dipti Sandesara, and Chetan Sandesara are also charged.\n\nNirav Modi\n\nJeweller and fashion designer Nirav Modi is charged with defrauding Punjab National Bank (PNB) of  \u20b914,000 crore in one of the largest banking frauds in Indian history. Modi imported pearls into India using phoney letters of undertaking (LoUs). Later, it came to light that Modi's LoUs had also been provided by PNB's Brady House branch in Fort, Mumbai, in violation of the law. He is currently seeking political asylum in the UK.\n\nNeeshal Modi\n\nNirav Modi's brother is Neeshal Modi, married to Mukesh and Anil Ambani's niece, Isheta Salgaocar. He is also charged with participating in the PNB Scam. In 2018, the CBI requested that the Ministry of Home Affairs extradite him from his country of citizenship, Belgium. He is said to be the beneficiary owner of numerous LoUs and fictitious businesses. He wrote to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in 2020 to distance himself from Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi.\n\nMehul Choksi\n\nNirav Modi's uncle Mehul Choksi was a part of the PNB scam. He was the proprietor of the retail jewellery company Gitanjali Group. In addition to corruption and criminal conspiracy, he is accused of money laundering and criminal breach of trust. Since 2018, he has resided in Antigua and Barbuda, where he is now a citizen.

He was the proprietor of the retail jewellery company Gitanjali Group. In addition to corruption and criminal conspiracy, he is accused of money laundering and criminal breach of trust.\n\nWhat is the Canara Bank Fraud\n\nThe Canara Bank and the Bank of Maharashtra had sanctioned  \u20b930 crore and  \u20b925 crore respectively as working capital facility under a consortium agreement to Bezel Jewellery.\n\nIt is alleged that though the loan was granted for the manufacturing and sale of gold and diamond-studded jewellery, the company did not route any of the business transactions through the account to hide diversion of funds.\n\nThe company did not repay the loan, causing a loss of  \u20b955.27 crore to the consortium, the agency has alleged.\n\nCBI has also booked Bezel Jewellery and its whole-time directors, including Choksi, Chetna Jhaveri, Dinesh Bhatia and Milind Limaye.\n\nWhat is the PNB scam?\n\nThe Choksi-Modi duo is suspected of defrauding Punjab National Bank (PNB) of more than  \u20b914,000 crore through the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, which Indian authorities want them for. Choksi has been arrested for criminal conspiracy, cheating, breach of trust, dishonesty, corruption, money laundering, and delivery of property.\n\nOn 16 April this year, it was reported that the properties of Choksi have been confiscated by the Income Tax department. The I-T sleuths have also seized Choksi's nine acres of agricultural land in Nashik.\n\nThe Punjab National Bank scam relates to the fraudulent letter of undertaking issued by the bank. Jeweller and designer Nirav Modi is the key accused in the case. Both Choksi and Modi fled India after the PNB scam came to light in early 2018. Choksi, promoter and managing director of Gitanjali Gems is the maternal uncle of Nirav Modi. The stock market regulatory body has banned Choksi from the capital markets for one year and has also levied a fine.\n\nWhere is Choksi now?\n\nSince 2018, he has resided in Antigua and Barbuda, where he is now a citizen. He vanished from the nation in 2021 and then reappeared in Dominica. He was turned away from the nation.\n\n\"Exciting news!
